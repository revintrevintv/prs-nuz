# prs-nuz (overlay scaffold — no ROMs)

This repo is a neutral scaffold for adding challenge features to a private, already-patched **GBA Pokémon ROM** (not included).

**Today:** it just builds a no-op patch (copies input ROM to output) so the pipeline is verified.
**Later:** we’ll add features one by one.
